# familamp
An IoT lamp based on John Harrison's Filimin networked RGB lights.

In essence, an inter-networked series of lamps using FastLED, ESP8266 and Arduino that 'communicate' by syncing across the internet.

I intend taking some elements from Horacio Bouzas' Web-configurable Wifi code for ESP8266, from 'Cheerlights' and from the amazing work done by the principals and contributors at FASTLed.

Hardware:

ESP8266 ESP-01 or ESP-03
Arduino Nano
WS2811/WS2812 Addressable RGB LEDs - in either a strip or a ring (like Adafruit's NeoPixel ring)

With great thanks to John Harrison for the inspiration and encouragement.
